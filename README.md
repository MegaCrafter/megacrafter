# MegaCrafter
Hi! I'm a versatile programmer. I have the ability of learning everything faster than the average person. This allows me to try so many things in small portions of time. (This is not bragging. Just stating a personal trait. Please no r/iamverysmart)

## Some Examples Of My Programming Fields
Desktop apps, mobile apps (android, flutter), web apps (full stack), networking (communication with packets), competitive programming, low-level systems...

## What Else?
I also do things other than programming. For example: illustration, sketch (mostly anime), modeling, making music (I play piano)...

## Contact

Be Strong!
